# Breakdown Generator

When you mix the nerdiness of html5 and Djent, you get the Breakdown Generator.

## What the fuck is that

When I am not coding, I am playing music. Like every developer I try to automate everything I do more than twice, so naturally I tried to automate music writing. Turns out, it's not a good idea. Who knew ?

## Improvements

Some ideas that would be cool to implement:

* record the audio to export
* MIDI file of the riff
